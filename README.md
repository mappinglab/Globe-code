# Globe-code
This is where I store my R scripts to create physical globes in ink and paper.

First I would like to warn you that I'm a beginner in coding and chose R solely based on the fact 
that it was the only language I knew.

You'll be very welcome to alert me about anything you've find erroneous or useless. 

Feel free to use those lines for your own creations.
